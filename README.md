# Modular-RL
Training different RL models has made significant progress but research towards utilizing a library of RL models is unexplored to a great extent. Given RL models for an environment with decomposed rewards, we aim to efficiently learn a combined RL model that works best for any polynomial combination of all decomposed rewards.
